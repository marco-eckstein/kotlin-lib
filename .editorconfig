# See: https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint/issues/873

# experimental:trailing-comma, trailing-comma
# Not desired, because we want to allow trailing commas
# We list both experimental:trailing-comma and trailing-comma because the IntelliJ plugin needs one,
# the library needs the other. This is probably due to the plugin using a different version of the library.
