# experimental:trailing-comma, trailing-comma
# Not desired, because we want to allow trailing commas
#
# For some rules, we list both the one with and the one without the "experimental:" prefix because the
# IntelliJ plugin needs one, the Gradle plugin needs the other. This is probably due to the IntelliJ plugin
# using a different version of the library.
